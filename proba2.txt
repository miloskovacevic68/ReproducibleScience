pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis.[2] In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series. It is free software released under the three-clause BSD license.[3] The name is derived from the term "panel data", an econometrics term for data sets that include observations over multiple time periods for the same individuals.[4] Its name is a play on the phrase "Python data analysis" itself.[5] Wes McKinney started building what would become pandas at AQR Capital while he was a researcher there from 2007 to 2010.
