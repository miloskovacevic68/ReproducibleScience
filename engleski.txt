The Adventure of Wisteria Lodge
CHAPTER I.
The Singular Experience of Mr. John Scott Eccles
I
find it recorded in my notebook that it
was a bleak and windy day towards the
end of March in the year 1892. Holmes
had received a telegram while we sat at
our lunch, and he had scribbled a reply. He made
no remark, but the matter remained in his thoughts,
for he stood in front of the fire afterwards with a
thoughtful face, smoking his pipe, and casting an
occasional glance at the message. Suddenly he
turned upon me with a mischievous twinkle in his
eyes.
“I suppose, Watson, we must look upon you as
a man of letters,” said he. “How do you define the
word ‘grotesque’?”
“Strange—remarkable,” I suggested.
He shook his head at my definition.
“There is surely something more than that,”
said he; “some underlying suggestion of the tragic
and the terrible. If you cast your mind back to some
of those narratives with which you have afflicted
a long-suffering public, you will recognize how of-
ten the grotesque has deepened into the criminal.
Think of that little affair of the red-headed men.
That was grotesque enough in the outset, and yet
it ended in a desperate attempt at robbery. Or,
again, there was that most grotesque affair of the
five orange pips, which let straight to a murderous
conspiracy. The word puts me on the alert.”
“Have you it there?” I asked.
He read the telegram aloud.
“Have just had most incredible and
grotesque experience. May I consult
you?
— “Scott Eccles,
“Post Office, Charing Cross.”
“Man or woman?” I asked.
“Oh, man, of course. No woman would ever
send a reply-paid telegram. She would have come.”
“Will you see him?”
“My dear Watson, you know how bored I have
been since we locked up Colonel Carruthers. My
mind is like a racing engine, tearing itself to pieces
because it is not connected up with the work for
which it was built. Life is commonplace, the pa-
pers are sterile; audacity and romance seem to have
passed forever from the criminal world. Can you
ask me, then, whether I am ready to look into any
new problem, however trivial it may prove? But
here, unless I am mistaken, is our client.”
A measured step was heard upon the stairs, and
a moment later a stout, tall, gray-whiskered and
solemnly respectable person was ushered into the
room. His life history was written in his heavy
features and pompous manner. From his spats
to his gold-rimmed spectacles he was a Conserva-
tive, a churchman, a good citizen, orthodox and
conventional to the last degree. But some amaz-
ing experience had disturbed his native composure
and left its traces in his bristling hair, his flushed,
angry cheeks, and his flurried, excited manner. He
plunged instantly into his business.
“I have had a most singular and unpleasant ex-
perience, Mr. Holmes,” said he. “Never in my life
have I been placed in such a situation. It is most
improper—most outrageous. I must insist upon
some explanation.” He swelled and puffed in his
anger.
“Pray sit down, Mr. Scott Eccles,” said Holmes
in a soothing voice. “May I ask, in the first place,
why you came to me at all?”
“Well, sir, it did not appear to be a matter which
concerned the police, and yet, when you have heard
the facts, you must admit that I could not leave it
where it was. Private detectives are a class with
whom I have absolutely no sympathy, but none the
less, having heard your name—”
“Quite so. But, in the second place, why did
you not come at once?”
“What do you mean?”
Holmes glanced at his watch.
“It is a quarter-past two,” he said. “Your tele-
gram was dispatched about one. But no one can
glance at your toilet and attire without seeing that
your disturbance dates from the moment of your
waking.”
Our client smoothed down his unbrushed hair
and felt his unshaven chin.
“You are right, Mr. Holmes. I never gave a
thought to my toilet. I was only too glad to get out
of such a house. But I have been running round
making inquiries before I came to you. I went to
the house agents, you know, and they said that
Mr. Garcia’s rent was paid up all right and that
everything was in order at Wisteria Lodge.”
“Come, come, sir,” said Holmes, laughing. “You
are like my friend, Dr. Watson, who has a bad habit
of telling his stories wrong end foremost. Please
arrange your thoughts and let me know, in their
7

due sequence, exactly what those events are which
have sent you out unbrushed and unkempt, with
dress boots and waistcoat buttoned awry, in search
of advice and assistance.”
Our client looked down with a rueful face at his
own unconventional appearance.
“I’m sure it must look very bad, Mr. Holmes,
and I am not aware that in my whole life such a
thing has ever happened before. But will tell you
the whole queer business, and when I have done
so you will admit, I am sure, that there has been
enough to excuse me.”
But his narrative was nipped in the bud. There
was a bustle outside, and Mrs. Hudson opened the
door to usher in two robust and official-looking
individuals, one of whom was well known to us as
Inspector Gregson of Scotland Yard, an energetic,
gallant, and, within his limitations, a capable officer.
He shook hands with Holmes and introduced his
comrade as Inspector Baynes, of the Surrey Con-
stabulary.
“We are hunting together, Mr. Holmes, and our
trail lay in this direction.” He turned his bulldog
eyes upon our visitor. “Are you Mr. John Scott
Eccles, of Popham House, Lee?”
“I am.”
“We have been following you about all the morn-
ing.”
“You traced him through the telegram, no
doubt,” said Holmes.
“Exactly, Mr. Holmes. We picked up the scent
at Charing Cross Post-Office and came on here.”
“But why do you follow me? What do you
want?”
“We wish a statement, Mr. Scott Eccles, as to the
events which let up to the death last night of Mr.
Aloysius Garcia, of Wisteria Lodge, near Esher.”
Our client had sat up with staring eyes and
every tinge of colour struck from his astonished
face.
“Dead? Did you say he was dead?”
“Yes, sir, he is dead.”
“But how? An accident?”
“Murder, if ever there was one upon earth.”
“Good God! This is awful! You don’t
mean—you don’t mean that I am suspected?”
“A letter of yours was found in the dead man’s
pocket, and we know by it that you had planned to
pass last night at his house.”
“So I did.”
“Oh, you did, did you?”
Out came the official notebook.
“Wait a bit, Gregson,” said Sherlock Holmes.
“All you desire is a plain statement, is it not?”
“And it is my duty to warn Mr. Scott Eccles that
it may be used against him.”
“Mr. Eccles was going to tell us about it when
you entered the room. I think, Watson, a brandy
and soda would do him no harm. Now, sir, I sug-
gest that you take no notice of this addition to your
audience, and that you proceed with your narra-
tive exactly as you would have done had you never
been interrupted.”
Our visitor had gulped off the brandy and the
colour had returned to his face. With a dubious
glance at the inspector’s notebook, he plunged at
once into his extraordinary statement.
“I am a bachelor,” said he, “and being of a so-
ciable turn I cultivate a large number of friends.
Among these are the family of a retired brewer
called Melville, living at Abermarle Mansion, Kens-
ington. It was at his table that I met some weeks
ago a young fellow named Garcia. He was, I under-
stood, of Spanish descent and connected in some
way with the embassy. He spoke perfect English,
was pleasing in his manners, and as good-looking
a man as ever I saw in my life.
“In some way we struck up quite a friendship,
this young fellow and I. He seemed to take a fancy
to me from the first, and within two days of our
meeting he came to see me at Lee. One thing led
to another, and it ended in his inviting me out to
spend a few days at his house, Wisteria Lodge, be-
tween Esher and Oxshott. Yesterday evening I went
to Esher to fulfil this engagement.
“He had described his household to me before
I went there. He lived with a faithful servant, a
countryman of his own, who looked after all his
needs. This fellow could speak English and did his
housekeeping for him. Then there was a wonderful
cook, he said, a half-breed whom he had picked up
in his travels, who could serve an excellent dinner.
I remember that he remarked what a queer house-
hold it was to find in the heart of Surrey, and that I
agreed with him, though it has proved a good deal
queerer than I thought.
“I drove to the place—about two miles on the
south side of Esher. The house was a fair-sized
one, standing back from the road, with a curv-
ing drive which was banked with high evergreen
shrubs. It was an old, tumbledown building in a
crazy state of disrepair. When the trap pulled up
on the grass-grown drive in front of the blotched
8
The Adventure of Wisteria Lodge
and weather-stained door, I had doubts as to my
wisdom in visiting a man whom I knew so slightly.
He opened the door himself, however, and greeted
me with a great show of cordiality. I was handed
over to the manservant, a melancholy, swarthy in-
dividual, who led the way, my bag in his hand,
to my bedroom. The whole place was depressing.
Our dinner was tˆete-`a-tˆete, and though my host did
his best to be entertaining, his thoughts seemed to
continually wander, and he talked so vaguely and
wildly that I could hardly understand him. He con-
tinually drummed his fingers on the table, gnawed
his nails, and gave other signs of nervous impa-
tience. The dinner itself was neither well served
nor well cooked, and the gloomy presence of the
taciturn servant did not help to enliven us. I can
assure you that many times in the course of the
evening I wished that I could invent some excuse
which would take me back to Lee.
“One thing comes back to my memory which
may have a bearing upon the business that you two
gentlemen are investigating. I thought nothing of
it at the time. Near the end of dinner a note was
handed in by the servant. I noticed that after my
host had read it he seemed even more distrait and
strange than before. He gave up all pretence at
conversation and sat, smoking endless cigarettes,
lost in his own thoughts, but he made no remark
as to the contents. About eleven I was glad to go
to bed. Some time later Garcia looked in at my
door—the room was dark at the time—and asked
me if I had rung. I said that I had not. He apolo-
gized for having disturbed me so late, saying that
it was nearly one o’clock. I dropped off after this
and slept soundly all night.
“And now I come to the amazing part of my tale.
When I woke it was broad daylight. I glanced at my
watch, and the time was nearly nine. I had particu-
larly asked to be called at eight, so I was very much
astonished at this forgetfulness. I sprang up and
rang for the servant. There was no response. I rang
again and again, with the same result. Then I came
to the conclusion that the bell was out of order. I
huddled on my clothes and hurried downstairs in
an exceedingly bad temper to order some hot water.
You can imagine my surprise when I found that
there was no one there. I shouted in the hall. There
was no answer. Then I ran from room to room. All
were deserted. My host had shown me which was
his bedroom the night before, so I knocked at the
door. No reply. I turned the handle and walked in.
The room was empty, and the bed had never been
slept in. He had gone with the rest. The foreign
host, the foreign footman, the foreign cook, all had
vanished in the night! That was the end of my visit
to Wisteria Lodge.”
Sherlock Holmes was rubbing his hands and
chuckling as he added this bizarre incident to his
collection of strange episodes.
“Your experience is, so far as I know, perfectly
unique,” said he. “May I ask, sir, what you did
then?”
“I was furious. My first idea was that I had been
the victim of some absurd practical joke. I packed
my things, banged the hall door behind me, and set
off for Esher, with my bag in my hand. I called at
Allan Brothers’, the chief land agents in the village,
and found that it was from this firm that the villa
had been rented. It struck me that the whole pro-
ceeding could hardly be for the purpose of making
a fool of me, and that the main objet must be to get
out of the rent. It is late in March, so quarter-day
is at hand. But this theory would not work. The
agent was obliged to me for my warning, but told
me that the rent had been paid in advance. Then
I made my way to town and called at the Spanish
embassy. The man was unknown there. After this
I went to see Melville, at whose house I had first
met Garcia, but I found that he really knew rather
less about him than I did. Finally when I got your
reply to my wire I came out to you, since I gather
that you are a person who gives advice in difficult
cases. But now, Mr. Inspector, I understand, from
what you said when you entered the room, that
you can carry the story on, and that some tragedy
had occurred. I can assure you that every word I
have said is the truth, and that, outside of what I
have told you, I know absolutely nothing about the
fate of this man. My only desire is to help the law
in every possible way.”
“I am sure of it, Mr. Scott Eccles—I am sure of
it,” said Inspector Gregson in a very amiable tone.
“I am bound to say that everything which you have
said agrees very closely with the facts as they have
come to our notice. For example, there was that
note which arrived during dinner. Did you chance
to observe what became of it?”
“Yes, I did. Garcia rolled it up and threw it into
the fire.”
“What do you say to that, Mr. Baynes?”
The country detective was a stout, puffy, red
man, whose face was only redeemed from gross-
ness by two extraordinarily bright eyes, almost hid-
den behind the heavy creases of cheek and brow.
With a slow smile he drew a folded and discoloured
scrap of paper from his pocket.
9
The Adventure of Wisteria Lodge
“It was a dog-grate, Mr. Holmes, and he over-
pitched it. I picked this out unburned from the
back of it.”
Holmes smiled his appreciation.
“You must have examined the house very care-
fully to find a single pellet of paper.”
“I did, Mr. Holmes. It’s my way. Shall I read it,
Mr. Gregson?”
The Londoner nodded.
“The note is written upon ordinary cream-laid
paper without watermark. It is a quarter-sheet.
The paper is cut off in two snips with a short-
bladed scissors. It has been folded over three times
and sealed with purple wax, put on hurriedly and
pressed down with some flat oval object. It is ad-
dressed to Mr. Garcia, Wisteria Lodge. It says:
“Our own colours, green and white.
Green open, white shut. Main stair,
first corridor, seventh right, green baize.
Godspeed.
— D.
“It is a woman’s writing, done with a sharp-
pointed pen, but the address is either done with
another pen or by someone else. It is thicker and
bolder, as you see.”
“A very remarkable note,” said Holmes, glanc-
ing it over. “I must compliment you, Mr. Baynes,
upon your attention to detail in your examina-
tion of it. A few trifling points might perhaps
be added. The oval seal is undoubtedly a plain
sleeve-link—what else is of such a shape? The scis-
sors were bent nail scissors. Short as the two snips
are, you can distinctly see the same slight curve in
each.”
The country detective chuckled.
“I thought I had squeezed all the juice out of
it, but I see there was a little over,” he said. “I’m
bound to say that I make nothing of the note ex-
cept that there was something on hand, and that a
woman, as usual, was at the bottom of it.”
Mr. Scott Eccles had fidgeted in his seat during
this conversation.
“I am glad you found the note, since it corrob-
orates my story,” said he. “But I beg to point out
that I have not yet heard what has happened to Mr.
Garcia, nor what has become of his household.”
“As to Garcia,” said Gregson, “that is easily an-
swered. He was found dead this morning upon
Oxshott Common, nearly a mile from his home. His
head had been smashed to pulp by heavy blows
of a sandbag or some such instrument, which had
crushed rather than wounded. It is a lonely corner,
and there is no house within a quarter of a mile of
the spot. He had apparently been struck down first
from behind, but his assailant had gone on beating
him long after he was dead. It was a most furious
assault. There are no footsteps nor any clue to the
criminals.”
“Robbed?”
“No, there was no attempt at robbery.”
“This is very painful—very painful and terrible,”
said Mr. Scott Eccles in a querulous voice, “but it is
really uncommonly hard on me. I had nothing to
do with my host going off upon a nocturnal excur-
sion and meeting so sad an end. How do I come to
be mixed up with the case?”
“Very simply, sir,” Inspector Baynes answered.
“The only document found in the pocket of the
deceased was a letter from you saying that you
would be with him on the night of his death. It was
the envelope of this letter which gave us the dead
man’s name and address. It was after nine this
morning when we reached his house and found
neither you nor anyone else inside it. I wired to
Mr. Gregson to run you down in London while I
examined Wisteria Lodge. Then I came into town,
joined Mr. Gregson, and here we are.”
“I think now,” said Gregson, rising, “we had
best put this matter into an official shape. You will
come round with us to the station, Mr. Scott Eccles,
and let us have your statement in writing.”
“Certainly, I will come at once. But I retain
your services, Mr. Holmes. I desire you to spare no
expense and no pains to get at the truth.”
My friend turned to the country inspector.
“I suppose that you have no objection to my
collaborating with you, Mr. Baynes?”
“Highly honoured, sir, I am sure.”
“You appear to have been very prompt and busi-
nesslike in all that you have done. Was there any
clue, may I ask, as to the exact hour that the man
met his death?”
“He had been there since one o’clock. There was
rain about that time, and his death had certainly
been before the rain.”
“But that is perfectly impossible, Mr. Baynes,”
cried our client. “His voice is unmistakable. I could
swear to it that it was he who addressed me in my
bedroom at that very hour.”
“Remarkable, but by no means impossible,”
said Holmes, smiling.
“You have a clue?” asked Gregson.
10
The Adventure of Wisteria Lodge
“On the face of it the case is not a very complex
one, though it certainly presents some novel and
interesting features. A further knowledge of facts
is necessary before I would venture to give a final
and definite opinion. By the way, Mr. Baynes, did
you find anything remarkable besides this note in
your examination of the house?”
The detective looked at my friend in a singular
way.
“There were,” said he, “one or two very remark-
able things. Perhaps when I have finished at the
police-station you would care to come out and give
me your opinion of them.”
“In am entirely at your service,” said Sherlock
Holmes, ringing the bell. “You will show these
gentlemen out, Mrs. Hudson, and kindly send the
boy with this telegram. He is to pay a five-shilling
reply.”
We sat for some time in silence after our visitors
had left. Holmes smoked hard, with his browns
drawn down over his keen eyes, and his head thrust
forward in the eager way characteristic of the man.
“Well, Watson,” he asked, turning suddenly
upon me, “what do you make of it?”
“I can make nothing of this mystification of
Scott Eccles.”
“But the crime?”
“Well, taken with the disappearance of the
man’s companions, I should say that they were
in some way concerned in the murder and had fled
from justice.”
“That is certainly a possible point of view. On
the face of it you must admit, however, that it is very
strange that his two servants should have been in a
conspiracy against him and should have attacked
him on the one night when he had a guest. They
had him alone at their mercy every other night in
the week.”
“Then why did they fly?”
“Quite so. Why did they fly? There is a big fact.
Another big fact is the remarkable experience of
our client, Scott Eccles. Now, my dear Watson, is
it beyond the limits of human ingenuity to furnish
an explanation which would cover both of these
big facts? If it were one which would also admit of
the mysterious note with its very curious phrase-
ology, why, then it would be worth accepting as
a temporary hypothesis. If the fresh facts which
come to our knowledge all fit themselves into the
scheme, then our hypothesis may gradually become
a solution.”
“But what is our hypothesis?”
Holmes leaned back in his chair with half-closed
eyes.
“You must admit, my dear Watson, that the idea
of a joke is impossible. There were grave events
afoot, as the sequel showed, and the coaxing of
Scott Eccles to Wisteria Lodge had some connec-
tion with them.”
“But what possible connection?”
“Let us take it link by link. There is, on the face
of it, something unnatural about this strange and
sudden friendship between the young Spaniard and
Scott Eccles. It was the former who forced the pace.
He called upon Eccles at the other end of London
on the very day after he first met him, and he kept
in close touch with him until he got him down to
Esher. Now, what did he want with Eccles? What
could Eccles supply? I see no charm in the man.
He is not particulary intelligent—not a man likely
to be congenial to a quick-witted Latin. Why, then,
was he picked out from all the other people whom
Garcia met as particularly suited to his purpose?
Has he any one outstanding quality? I say that he
has. He is the very type of conventional British
respectability, and the very man as a witness to
impress another Briton. You saw yourself how nei-
ther of the inspectors dreamed of questioning his
statement, extraordinary as it was.”
“But what was he to witness?”
“Nothing, as things turned out, but everything
had they gone another way. That is how I read the
matter.”
“I see, he might have proved an alibi.”
“Exactly, my dear Watson; he might have proved
an alibi. We will suppose, for argument’s sake, that
the household of Wisteria Lodge are confederates
in some design. The attempt, whatever it may be,
is to come off, we will say, before one o’clock. By
some juggling of the clocks it is quite possible that
they may have got Scott Eccles to bed earlier than
he thought, but in any case it is likely that when
Garcia went out of his way to tell him that it was
one it was really not more than twelve. If Garcia
could do whatever he had to do and be back by the
hour mentioned he had evidently a powerful reply
to any accusation. Here was this irreproachable
Englishman ready to swear in any court of law that
the accused was in the house all the time. It was an
insurance against the worst.”
“Yes, yes, I see that. But how about the disap-
pearance of the others?”
“I have not all my facts yet, but I do not think
there are any insuperable difficulties. Still, it is
an error to argue in front of your data. You find
